# Project:Recipes
_This is a project to show what I've learnt in the HTML Foundations module of the Foundations course of The Odin Project._

For this project, I have to build a basic recipe website. I have learnt the basic html boilerplate, learnt about how to present information in my body, make links and images and also learnt how to write good commit messages! Hopefully, these skills shine through in this project.

I learnt how to make the basic html boilerplate (which I did for every file right off the bat), learnt how to make ordered and unordered lists and headings with varying sizes which are displayed in the webpages. I also learnt some basic text editing (like italic and bold) one of which I have employed in the Paneer Sabzi recipe description.

It is worth noting that the images attached in the Reuben Casserole and Chicken Pastina recipes did not show up on the website I published (https://lucifer179.github.io/odin-recipes/) but they did in the preview. So I changed the image formats from png to jpg which seems to have done the trick. Not sure why it didn't work but I'll take it.

I also made as _atomic_ as commits as possible for this project and did my best to employ the things I learnt in the commit messages module.
