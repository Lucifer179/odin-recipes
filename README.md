# Project:Recipes
_This is a project to show what I've learnt in the HTML Foundations module of the Foundations course of The Odin Project._

For this project, I have to build a basic recipe website. I have learnt the basic html boilerplate, learnt about how to present information in my body, make links and images and also learnt how to write good commit messages! Hopefully, these skills shine through in this project.
